SortRunner

Written in c++.

Main goal is to get to the upper floor (heaven gate) in as few cycles as posible.

You will need to sort stairs in your way. The trick is to choose the right sorting algorithm for every particular stairs. But be careful! You have limited number of uses of each algorithm, so choose wisely. If you waste the most effective algorithm for stairs with just a few steps, you will have problem with bigger ones and thus end up with bad score. 

Basic knowledge of sorting algorithm is a benefit :).

Lets sort your stairway to heaven!
